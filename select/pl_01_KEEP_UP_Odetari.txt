('Tari, get over here)
Keep up, I'm too fa-ast,
I'm too fa-a-ast
Push my foot up on that pedal,
then I'm gone
(G-g-g-gone, g-g-gone, gone)
Keep up on my track, on my track
'Fore I dust it,
keep my numbers going strong
(Strong, strong,
str-str-str-strong)
Let's start the war,
I love it when it's like that
G-go ahead,
I'll get ya right back
I-I-I love it
when you fight back
I'm up, so, where yo' flight at?
N-n-no (Hell nah, nah, nah,
keep fussin')
L-I-life-,
life's paid to hell was chosen
Keep up, I'm too fa-ast,
I'm too fa-a-ast
Push my foot up on that pedal,
then I'm gone
(G-g-g-gone, g-g-gone, gone)
Keep up on my track, on my track
'Fore I dust it,
keep my numbers going strong
(Strong, strong,
str-str-str-strong;
let's tr-tr-trance now)
I'm good how I'm lookin' slashed
From the span like a bidet
(Trance now)
Everybody here get busy,
everybody here get busy
Give me everything
you took from me
(Give me everything
you took from me)
Keep up, I'm too fa-ast,
I'm too fa-a-ast
Push my foot up on that pedal,
then I'm gone
(G-g-g-gone, g-g-gone, gone)
Keep up on my track, on my track
'Fore I dust it,
keep my numbers going strong
(Strong, strong,
str-str-str-strong; let's-)
Lust up my coat, bitch,
I'm rockin' chinchilla
Nah, bitch,
I ain't a drug dealer
Makin' money while I sleep
Makin' money while I eat,
my stomach so full of
I need somethin' everyday,
I heard somethin' every week
I don't know what's gon' fit up
Either way,
they know I'm not cheap
They should've been
this world-ass freak
While my bank still fill up
Fa-ast, I'm too fast
Push my foot up on that pedal,
then I'm gone
(G-g-g-gone, g-g-gone, gone)
Keep up on my track, on my track
'Fore I dust it,
keep my numbers going strong
(Strong, strong,
str-str-str-strong)
